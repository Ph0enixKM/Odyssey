## Odyssey is a rich text editor for writers, novelists and poets. 
It provides more natural way of designig documents,books,poems
treating page as a piece of paper...
Feel free to try out current stable version (1.2.9). Do not hesitate to report any kind of bug. This helps me to develop Odyssey 
in a good direction.


**Warning:**

    Do not use the following version in serious documents because it lacks of a lot of major features.
    I'm suspecting it to be ready to use around version 2.0.0.
