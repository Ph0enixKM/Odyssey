![Odyssey Logo](https://github.com/Ph0enixKM/Odyssey/blob/dev/public/arts/logo-250.png)

## Odyssey is a rich text editor for writers, novelists and poets. 
It provides more natural way of designig documents,books,poems
treating page as a piece of paper...
Feel free to try out current stable version (1.2.9). Do not hesitate to report any kind of bug. This helps me to develop Odyssey 
in a good direction.


**Warning:**

    Do not use the following version in serious documents because it lacks of a lot of major features.
    I'm suspecting it to be ready to use around version 2.0.0.

## Instalation
In order to install Odyssey using github, clone current project:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Ph0enixKM/Odyssey.git

After that you should see a folder called "Odyssey". Open it up using the following command:

    $ cd Odyssey
    
It's time to install all dependencies using NPM (If you don't have Node.js installed, you can grab it in the following site: https://nodejs.org/en/)

    $ npm install
    
All of the dependencies should be installed. Now we can open up Odyssey.

## Executing
To execute Odyssey you can just use npm script command:

    $ npm start

Now you should see Electron in action. 
After couple of seconds an Odyssey window should appear.
